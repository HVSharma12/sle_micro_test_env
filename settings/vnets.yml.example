#
# Specify list of Libvirt Networks to be managed
#
# It is recommended to have at least one network be DHCP enabled,
# called 'sle_micromgmnt' as in the example below, which can be used
# to manage the VMs once they have been created. To simplify
# determining the IP address of the VMs its is recommended that
# you define mac and ip values for the VM nics on the sle_micromgmt
# network so that DHCP static reservations can be defined for
# the VM nic.
#
# NOTE: If existing Libvirt networks are using the specified
# virbrX bridges you will need to either change the virbrX
# values appropriately, or else remove the existing Libvirt
# networks.
